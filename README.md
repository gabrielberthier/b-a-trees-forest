# b-a-trees-forest

This is a project aimed to turn publicly examples of Tree Data Structures using Typescript, since it is a very dynamic, multi-paradigm, OOP language, providing an easier syntax and coherent operations.

The name of this repository is supposed to be read as Beatriz (my girlfriend's name) Forrest.
